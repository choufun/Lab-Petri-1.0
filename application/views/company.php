      Research Projects
    </h3>
    <p>
       Lab Petri aims to improve how research is conducted at universities by allowing for a more collaborative environment. 
			Labs can share their research interdepartmentally or even between individual universities so as to help researchers with their own projects and inspire new research. Lab Petri facilitates the sharing of ideas and discoveries between users.
			Lab Petri is a platform on which users can collaborate and collectively advance their research.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column one-third">
    <h3>Students</h3>
    <p>
         Students need more exposure to research to learn how to solve real world problem.
			Graduate programs are extremely competitive and often require students to have prior research experience during their undergraduate careers. 
			Finding a suitable research project from a student perspective may be daunting and, in order to get the most out of one's project, it is important to find one that piques interest and inspires passion.
			Lab Petri can help students find research projects that interest them and connect with professors or other points of contact so that they can get involved.

  <div class="column one-third">
    <h3>Professors</h3>
    <p>
       Professors can use Lab Petri to find suitable help for their projects from within their universities or from other universities.
			Courses, seminars, conferences and email correspondence are some of the only means of communication for students to utilize to network with professors in regards to finding a research opportunity.
			Lab Petri aims to bridge this gap.
