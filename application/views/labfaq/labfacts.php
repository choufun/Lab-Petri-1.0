               Lab Petri is a nonprofit organization and networking website that helps promote education in STEM.

              These three tabs represent our main foci for our users. We'd like Lab Petri to be a place where students who want extracurricular
              opportunities and employment in the STEM fields can view what other students are up to, post their own reasearch to share
              and open a conversation in regards to collaboration, and search for job/laboratory opportunities and inquries from various 
              universities and companies.
