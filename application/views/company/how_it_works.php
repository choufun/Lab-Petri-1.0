         <strong>           
            Lab Petri connects employers to students by not only allowing them to view projects and activities that have been posted on the site by students,
            but list job postings that students can view, apply to, and comment on.
            Lab Petriâ€™s unique forum based posting system makes student-employer communication more interactive.
