      <h5>Connect with Professors</h5>
      <p>
         Lab Petri aims to connect students and professors to allow students to inquire about open positions in research labs. 
         This task may be daunting otherwise. Lab Petri would like to help facilitate this process.

      <h5>Build Your Resume</h5>
      <p>
        Research is an important part of a well-rounded academic experience for an undergraduate student. Those who enter research labs, and are published in academic journals as a result, end up with a significant advantage in terms of finding future employment or entering graduate school. 
        We would like research to be a more fundamental aspect of the curriculum of the average student in a STEM major
         <!--Students who find research through lab petri are given stipends through which they can be compensated for their work where they otherwise would not.                        
         We would like students to actively search for research using our platform and be financially compensated for their hard work. This is achieved through
         grant applications on the company end. 

            Student assistants that graduate students would otherwise be hard-pressed 
            to find will accessible through Lab Petri.

        Students can view what other students are researching and can connect with one another to ask questions and collaborate.
         We hope that this collaborative environment that is provided through our forum system will inspire new projects, discoveries, and serendipitous teamwork.

      <h5>Making it Simpler To Find Lab Assistants</h5>
      <p>

         Our goal is to make professors' workload smaller so that they achieve more.                   

         Lab Petri hopes to simplify the process of finding student assistants for professors so as to not only provide more opportunities for students to get 
         noticed but help professors save time in the process of selecting them.

      <h5>Expand Your Research Presence</h5>
      <p>
         By allowing graduate students and professors to post descriptions of research projects, students can learn more about the lab's activities.
         This will expand interest in the lab's research further and faster than conferencing, graduate defenses, and writing grants might.
