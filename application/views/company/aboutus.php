                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a non-profit organization, our goals are to increase participation in STEM fields amongst all students from every cultural and socioeconomic background.
                We hope to show our users that opportunities in STEM aren’t reserved for any elite class of individual but are available for those who have a good learning and working attitude.
                Lab Petri engineers tools that facilitate these goals.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intention is to create platforms through which students can network with their peers, professors, and industry professionals.
                We also want to create a space for students to share their experiences in STEM.
                We’d like to facilitate a culture of collaboration between students across domestic and international borders with our tools as a medium.
                The future world we envision, and hope to help bring about, would encourage global collaboration and eliminate any socioeconomic barriers to entering the STEM field.
                Through our efforts we’d like to bring a better future sooner.
