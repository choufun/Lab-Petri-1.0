                Lab Petri’s mission is to create a community for all STEM majors so they may benefit from each other’s wisdom and experience.
                As a non-profit organization, our goals are to increase participation in STEM fields amongst all students from every cultural and socioeconomic background.
                We hope to show our users that opportunities in STEM aren’t reserved for any elite class of individual but are available for those who have a good learning and working attitude.
            </strong>
